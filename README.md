This project is a WIP. The goal is to make a simple 3d game engine for golang.
Currently we have a opengl graphics backend, but we may look into other graphics backends soon.

### Examples
check the `./examples` dir for some basic examples

### OpenGL

#### Check OpenGL version

```bash
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version" 
```
